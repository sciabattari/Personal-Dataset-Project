# Scott Ciabattari's Personal Dataset Project

## Motivating Question
- When I set out onto this project, I knew I wanted to do something about sports.  Sports have been a passion of mine for my entire life and it is what I plan on going into for my career. Once I knew I wanted to base my personal dataset around sports, I shifted to which sport I wanted to focus on.  Football was the obvious answer, and it was justified by the fact that the NFL offseason is upon us and in full swing.  I knew I wanted to focuz on the business side of sports with salary caps, so that is where my mind went next.  I have noticed a trend in the NFL recently and I pulled up a statistic to back up my claim. No team has ever won the Super Bowl with a Quarterback taking up more than 13% of the total cap space allowed. This statistic puzzled me, and I set out to look into the numbers behind it.  The motivating question I will be answering is: How does a Quarterback's salary impact the total wins a football team has in a year

## Data Process
### Sourcing
- I obtained my data from <a href="https://overthecap.com/"> Over the Cap</a> [1], where I extrated the salary data for all NFL teams in the 2019 season.  I wanted to look at a recent season, but I was afraid to use the 2020 data because I felt it might've been scewed and out of line in recent years due to COVID.  Teams wanted to spend less money in 2020 due to a drop in the salary cap and less revenue coming in.  That is why I chose the 2019 season, as the more recent "normal" season.  From the data I extracted, I took and cleaned the data for Offensive spending (total money spent on the offense), Defensive spending (total money spent on the defense), and QB spending (total money spent on the Quarterback position) for all 32 NFL teams.
