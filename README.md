# Scott Ciabattari's Personal Dataset Project

## Motivating Question
- When I set out onto this project, I knew I wanted to do something about sports.  Sports have been a passion of mine for my entire life and it is what I plan on going into for my career. Once I knew I wanted to base my personal dataset around sports, I shifted to which sport I wanted to focus on.  Football was the obvious answer, and it was justified by the fact that the NFL offseason is upon us and in full swing.  I knew I wanted to focuz on the business side of sports with salary caps, so that is where my mind went next.  I have noticed a trend in the NFL recently and I pulled up a statistic to back up my claim. No team has ever won the Super Bowl with a Quarterback taking up more than 13% of the total cap space allowed. This statistic puzzled me, and I set out to look into the numbers behind it.  The motivating question I will be answering is: How does a Quarterback's salary impact the total wins a football team has in a year
